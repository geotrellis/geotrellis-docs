# GeoTrellis Documentation

This repo is the home of the GeoTrellis documentation. It does not yet have a home on the web.

## Editing the docs

All of the documentation source lives in `./docs`.

Start the mdoc watcher with `./scripts/server`. Once the documentation has compiled, it will be available at `./target/mdoc`.
